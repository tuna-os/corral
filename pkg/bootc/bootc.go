// Package bootc separates building a bootable-container disk from putting it
// on a backend (#130).
//
// The bootc plugin did both at once: a privileged Job on the cluster ran
// `bootc install to-disk` into a PVC, and the same code then created the
// KubeVirt VM around it. Nothing between those two steps was reusable, so a
// laptop or a libvirt host could not have a bootc VM at all — even though the
// disk a bootc image produces is an ordinary bootable disk that any hypervisor
// can run.
//
// Splitting it gives two small interfaces:
//
//	Builder  bootc container image  →  a bootable disk image
//	Target   a bootable disk image  →  an instance on some backend
//
// They compose in any pairing that makes sense. Building on the cluster and
// running on the cluster is the existing path. Building locally with podman
// and running locally under QEMU is new, and so is building locally and
// defining a libvirt domain.
