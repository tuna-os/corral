// Package backend is the parity matrix: for every operation Corral ships, what
// each backend does about it — and where it does nothing, whether that is
// because the backend cannot, or only because Corral has not.
//
// It exists because the honest state of the codebase was "KubeVirt is
// first-class and the rest are best effort", and that state was invisible.
// Capabilities were a hardcoded table in types.CapabilitiesForBackend, the
// richer operations were reached by `if backend == "kubevirt"` branches in
// cmd/ and pkg/web, and nothing anywhere said which absences were deliberate.
// A gap you cannot enumerate is a gap nobody closes.
//
// So the matrix is data, in one place, and it is enforced: conformance tests
// check it against the declared capabilities, against pkg/snapshot's adapter
// registry, and against docs/backend-parity.md, so the table in the docs cannot
// drift from the code and a capability cannot be advertised that nothing
// implements.
//
// The rule this encodes, per the parity decision: if a backend can do a thing
// we ship, we want to support it. Not every backend feature — parity across
// backends for the features Corral has.
